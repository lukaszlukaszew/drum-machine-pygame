# Welcome to the Amazing Drum Machine

What is a drum machine you may ask? It's electronic instrument which allows you to create, store and play beats based on more than one sound without knowledge of musical notation.

This repository is based on the YouTube course (including sound files):

I've also included some other features:
* fully scallable grid & menu based on current app resolution,
* resizable app window,
* limits on deleting and adding both beats and BPM (prevents original version from possible crashes),
* limit for the number of saved beats,
* sound channels based on filenames which makes it easier to add or remove sounds,
* blockade of loading beats when current channels don't match to saved ones,
* I've also cleaned original code almost whenever I thought it's necessary.

At the bottom of this readme file you will find some screenshots of my work.

## How can you run it?
To run this on your machine you need all files from repository (some free disk space, for the music), Python (ver. 3.10) and following modules:
- pygame (ver. 2.1.2)

If you have it all, just run main.py, and have fun!

Have a great day!
